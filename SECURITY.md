# Security Policy

This repository contains a small shell script that configures system trust and smart‑card services.
While the project itself does not process secrets, **logs and screenshots can contain sensitive information**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please open a GitHub Issue and add the `security` label.
- Do **not** include credentials, private keys, or internal URLs in issues.
- If sensitive details are required, contact the maintainer first and share minimal repro steps without secrets.

## Safe Reporting Checklist

- Redact any personal info (names, emails, serial numbers).
- Sanitize logs where needed.
- Include environment info (Fedora release, kernel, browser packaging) and the per‑run log path only.
